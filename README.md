## What Our Program Does & How to Use it
Our program determines whether the number of characters in the user's input is even or odd by utilizing the mod operator to check for a remainder when the input's length is divided by 2. The user can work our program by simply entering their desired input when prompted by the program to do so.

## How to Contribute
Feel free to make any stylistic modifications to the code as you see fit. As the code of conduct outlines, please do not alter the overall function of the program which determines whether the number of characters in the input is even or odd. We also ask that you submit pull requests after making changes.

## How Software is Licensed in the Installation/Use Section
The pre-existing open-source license that we utilized gives full creative freedom for collaborators to contribute to and use the program. It can also be copied and altered in any way that the collaborator may see fit.
